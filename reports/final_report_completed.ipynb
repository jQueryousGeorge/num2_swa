    "# Southwest Airlines: Relationship Between Load Factor and On-Time Performance\n",
    "## Analysis of Top 5 Domestic Routes (January 2020 - June 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis examines the relationship between Southwest Airlines' load factor (capacity utilization) and on-time performance (OTP) across their top 5 domestic routes from January 2020 through June 2025. The study aims to determine whether higher load factors correlate with changes in operational punctuality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Question:** How does Southwest's OTP relate to the Load Factor of its flights on the top 5 domestic routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overall Correlation**: The analysis reveals a **very strong negative correlation** (r = -0.730) between load factor and departure on-time performance across all routes combined. This relationship is **highly significant (p < 0.001)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Route-Specific Patterns**: Different routes show varying relationships between load factor and OTP:\n",
    "   - **DEN-PHX**: r = -0.704 (significant)\n",
    "   - **SAN-SMF**: r = -0.745 (significant)\n",
    "   - **DAL-HOU**: r = -0.787 (significant)\n",
    "   - **BWI-MCO**: r = -0.782 (significant)\n",
    "   - **SAN-SJC**: r = -0.770 (significant)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Factor Impact**: Analysis across load factor bins shows:\n",
    "   - Flights with load factors **< 70%**: 88.1% departure OTP\n",
    "   - Flights with load factors **85%+**: 67.0% departure OTP\n",
    "   - OTP decreases as load factors increase\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Coverage**: Analysis based on 330 route-month observations across 5 routes, representing 22,595,344 total passengers and 199,910 total flights.\n",

    "\n",
    "These routes represent Southwest's highest-volume domestic markets, accounting for 2.9% of all Southwest domestic passengers during this period. The routes show an average load factor of 71.5%, indicating strong capacity utilization across these key markets.\n",

    "**Significance levels:** * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals a **very strong negative correlation** between load factor and departure on-time performance. As flights become fuller (higher load factors), on-time performance tends to decrease. This suggests that operating at higher capacity utilization may create operational challenges that impact punctuality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation coefficient of -0.730 indicates that for every 10 percentage point increase in load factor, departure OTP decreases by approximately 7.3 percentage points on average. This relationship is highly significant (p < 0.001), providing strong evidence of a meaningful connection between capacity utilization and operational performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar patterns are observed for arrival on-time performance (r = -0.698), suggesting that the load factor effects persist throughout the flight operation, not just during departure.\n",

    "There is a clear degradation in OTP as load factors increase, with a 21.1 percentage point decline from the lowest to highest load factor bins.

    "## 6. Temporal Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### COVID-19 Impact (2020-2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis period includes the COVID-19 pandemic, which dramatically impacted airline operations:\n",
    "- Load factors dropped significantly in 2020, particularly during Q2-Q3\n",
    "- Recovery began in late 2020 and accelerated through 2021\n",
    "- On-time performance showed high variability during this period due to schedule uncertainty and operational adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Pandemic Period (2022-2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations stabilized during the recovery period:\n",
    "- Load factors returned to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022\n",
    "- OTP metrics normalized as operational schedules stabilized\n",
    "- Current performance (2024-2025) reflects mature post-pandemic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seasonal Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly analysis reveals typical seasonal patterns:\n",
    "- Summer months (June-August) show higher load factors due to leisure travel demand\n",
    "- Holiday periods show moderate OTP challenges\n",
    "- Weather-related delays impact winter months more significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Business Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operational Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capacity Planning**\n",
    "   - Southwest can generally operate at high load factors (71.5% average) without severe OTP degradation\n",
    "   - The relationship between load factor and OTP is very strong negative, meaning capacity decisions can focus primarily on revenue optimization\n",
    "   - Route-specific patterns should inform targeted operational improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schedule Optimization**\n",
    "   - Routes showing negative load factor-OTP correlations may benefit from:\n",
    "     * Extended turnaround times during high-load periods\n",
    "     * Enhanced ground operations support\n",
    "     * Adjusted boarding procedures for full flights\n",
    "   - Routes with weak correlations can maintain aggressive scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customer Experience**\n",
    "   - With average OTP of 78.6% for departures and 81.0% for arrivals, Southwest maintains competitive performance\n",
    "   - Load factor-OTP relationship does not suggest significant customer experience trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis, we recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continue Aggressive Load Factor Optimization**\n",
    "   - Rationale: The very strong negative correlation indicates load factor has minimal negative impact on OTP\n",
    "   - Expected Impact: Revenue maximization without operational performance degradation\n",
    "   - Implementation: Maintain current yield management practices\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Route-Specific Operational Focus**\n",
    "   - Rationale: Different routes show varying load factor-OTP relationships\n",
    "   - Expected Impact: Targeted improvements where challenges exist\n",
    "   - Implementation: Identify routes with r < -0.3 for operational review\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Monitor Load Factor Thresholds**\n",
    "   - Rationale: Some evidence of OTP changes at extreme load factors\n",
    "   - Expected Impact: Prevent operational stress at capacity limits\n",
    "   - Implementation: Set operational alerts when route-month load factors exceed 90%\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Limitations and Future Research\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aggregation Level**: Monthly aggregation may mask day-to-day and even hour-to-hour variations in the load factor-OTP relationship\n",
    "2. **External Factors**: Weather, ATC delays, airport congestion not fully captured in analysis\n",
    "3. **Route Specificity**: Results specific to Southwest's network, operational model, and top 5 routes\n",
    "4. **Time Period**: Includes atypical COVID-19 period which may skew some patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Research Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Granular Analysis**: Examine flight-level data to understand within-day patterns\n",
    "2. **Airport-Specific Factors**: Control for origin/destination airport constraints and characteristics\n",
    "3. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare Southwest patterns with other major carriers\n",
    "4. **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to forecast OTP based on planned load factors and other variables\n",
    "5. **Operational Metrics**: Include aircraft turnaround times, crew scheduling, and maintenance patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does Southwest's OTP relate to Load Factor on their top 5 routes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of 330 monthly observations across Southwest's top 5 domestic routes from January 2020 to June 2025 reveals a **very strong negative correlation** (r = -0.730, highly significant (p < 0.001)) between load factor and on-time performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship suggests that operational performance deteriorates as flights become fuller, though the magnitude is moderate. Southwest should consider this trade-off in capacity planning decisions, particularly on routes showing stronger correlations.\n",
