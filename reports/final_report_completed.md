# Southwest Airlines: Relationship Between Load Factor and On-Time Performance
## Analysis of Top 5 Domestic Routes (January 2020 - June 2025)

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the relationship between Southwest Airlines' load factor (capacity utilization) and on-time performance (OTP) across their top 5 domestic routes from January 2020 through June 2025. The study aims to determine whether higher load factors correlate with changes in operational punctuality.

**Key Question:** How does Southwest's OTP relate to the Load Factor of its flights on the top 5 domestic routes?

### Key Findings

1. **Overall Correlation**: The analysis reveals a **very strong negative correlation** (r = -0.730) between load factor and departure on-time performance across all routes combined. This relationship is **highly significant (p < 0.001)**.

2. **Route-Specific Patterns**: Different routes show varying relationships between load factor and OTP:
   - **DAL-HOU**: r = -0.787 (significant)
   - **DEN-PHX**: r = -0.704 (significant)
   - **SAN-SMF**: r = -0.745 (significant)
   - **SAN-SJC**: r = -0.770 (significant)
   - **BWI-MCO**: r = -0.782 (significant)

3. **Load Factor Impact**: Analysis across load factor bins shows:
   - Flights with load factors **< 70%**: 88.1% departure OTP
   - Flights with load factors **85%+**: 67.0% departure OTP
   - OTP decreases as load factors increase

4. **Data Coverage**: Analysis based on 330 route-month observations across 5 routes, representing 22,595,344 total passengers and 199,910 total flights.

### Route Rankings

| Rank | Route | Cities | Total Passengers | Total Flights | Avg Load Factor |
|------|-------|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | DEN-PHX | Denver, CO ↔ Phoenix, AZ | 5,081,022 | 41,569 | 76.2% |
| 2 | SAN-SMF | San Diego, CA ↔ Sacramento, CA | 4,647,018 | 40,718 | 74.7% |
| 3 | DAL-HOU | Dallas (Love Field), TX ↔ Houston (Hobby), TX | 4,407,845 | 41,691 | 68.7% |
| 4 | BWI-MCO | Baltimore, MD ↔ Orlando, FL | 4,264,633 | 36,211 | 74.0% |
| 5 | SAN-SJC | San Diego, CA ↔ SJC | 4,194,826 | 39,721 | 69.4% |

### Route Characteristics

## 3. Overall Relationship: Load Factor vs OTP

### Statistical Results

**All Routes Combined (N = 330 route-months)**

| Metric Pair | Pearson r | p-value | Spearman ρ | p-value | Interpretation |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Load Factor vs Dep OTP | -0.730 | 0.0000 | -0.698 | 0.0000 | very strong negative, highly significant (p < 0.001) |
| Load Factor vs Arr OTP | -0.698 | 0.0000 | -0.666 | 0.0000 | strong negative, highly significant (p < 0.001) |

**Significance levels:** * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001

### Interpretation

The analysis reveals a **very strong negative correlation** between load factor and departure on-time performance. As flights become fuller (higher load factors), on-time performance tends to decrease. This suggests that operating at higher capacity utilization may create operational challenges that impact punctuality.

The correlation coefficient of -0.730 indicates that for every 10 percentage point increase in load factor, departure OTP decreases by approximately 7.3 percentage points on average. This relationship is highly significant (p < 0.001), providing strong evidence of a meaningful connection between capacity utilization and operational performance.

Similar patterns are observed for arrival on-time performance (r = -0.698), suggesting that the load factor effects persist throughout the flight operation, not just during departure.

## 5. Load Factor Threshold Analysis

### OTP by Load Factor Bin

| Load Factor Range | Avg Dep OTP | Avg Arr OTP | Cancellation Rate | Sample Size |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| < 70% | 88.1% | 89.6% | 5.39% | 68062 |
| 70-75% | 78.3% | 80.7% | 1.95% | 26109 |
| 75-80% | 76.0% | 78.4% | 1.72% | 42071 |
| 80-85% | 73.9% | 76.6% | 1.85% | 42961 |
| 85%+ | 67.0% | 71.5% | 2.65% | 25564 |

### Key Insights

There is a clear degradation in OTP as load factors increase, with a 21.1 percentage point decline from the lowest to highest load factor bins. The most significant drop occurs above 80% load factor, suggesting this may represent an operational stress threshold where fuller planes create boarding, turnaround, and operational challenges.

## 6. Temporal Patterns

### COVID-19 Impact (2020-2021)

The analysis period includes the COVID-19 pandemic, which dramatically impacted airline operations:
- Load factors dropped significantly in 2020, particularly during Q2-Q3
- Recovery began in late 2020 and accelerated through 2021
- On-time performance showed high variability during this period due to schedule uncertainty and operational adjustments

### Post-Pandemic Period (2022-2025)

Operations stabilized during the recovery period:
- Load factors returned to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022
- OTP metrics normalized as operational schedules stabilized
- Current performance (2024-2025) reflects mature post-pandemic operations

### Seasonal Patterns

Monthly analysis reveals typical seasonal patterns:
- Summer months (June-August) show higher load factors due to leisure travel demand
- Holiday periods show moderate OTP challenges
- Weather-related delays impact winter months more significantly

## 7. Business Implications

### Operational Considerations

1. **Capacity Planning**
   - Southwest can generally operate at high load factors (71.5% average) without severe OTP degradation
   - The relationship between load factor and OTP is very strong negative, meaning capacity decisions can focus primarily on revenue optimization
   - Route-specific patterns should inform targeted operational improvements

2. **Schedule Optimization**
   - Routes showing negative load factor-OTP correlations may benefit from:
     * Extended turnaround times during high-load periods
     * Enhanced ground operations support
     * Adjusted boarding procedures for full flights
   - Routes with weak correlations can maintain aggressive scheduling

3. **Customer Experience**
   - With average OTP of 78.6% for departures and 81.0% for arrivals, Southwest maintains competitive performance
   - Load factor-OTP relationship does not suggest significant customer experience trade-offs

### Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend:

1. **Continue Aggressive Load Factor Optimization**
   - Rationale: The very strong negative correlation indicates load factor has minimal negative impact on OTP
   - Expected Impact: Revenue maximization without operational performance degradation
   - Implementation: Maintain current yield management practices

2. **Route-Specific Operational Focus**
   - Rationale: Different routes show varying load factor-OTP relationships
   - Expected Impact: Targeted improvements where challenges exist
   - Implementation: Identify routes with r < -0.3 for operational review

3. **Monitor Load Factor Thresholds**
   - Rationale: Some evidence of OTP changes at extreme load factors
   - Expected Impact: Prevent operational stress at capacity limits
   - Implementation: Set operational alerts when route-month load factors exceed 90%

## 8. Limitations and Future Research

### Limitations

1. **Aggregation Level**: Monthly aggregation may mask day-to-day and even hour-to-hour variations in the load factor-OTP relationship
2. **External Factors**: Weather, ATC delays, airport congestion not fully captured in analysis
3. **Route Specificity**: Results specific to Southwest's network, operational model, and top 5 routes
4. **Time Period**: Includes atypical COVID-19 period which may skew some patterns

### Future Research Directions

1. **Granular Analysis**: Examine flight-level data to understand within-day patterns
2. **Airport-Specific Factors**: Control for origin/destination airport constraints and characteristics
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare Southwest patterns with other major carriers
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to forecast OTP based on planned load factors and other variables
5. **Operational Metrics**: Include aircraft turnaround times, crew scheduling, and maintenance patterns

## 9. Conclusion

**How does Southwest's OTP relate to Load Factor on their top 5 routes?**

The analysis of 330 monthly observations across Southwest's top 5 domestic routes from January 2020 to June 2025 reveals a **very strong negative correlation** (r = -0.730, highly significant (p < 0.001)) between load factor and on-time performance. 

This relationship suggests that operational performance deteriorates as flights become fuller, though the magnitude is moderate. Southwest should consider this trade-off in capacity planning decisions, particularly on routes showing stronger correlations.
